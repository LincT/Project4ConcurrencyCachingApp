# Capstone Project 4 - APIs, Concurrency and Caching Application
> The application will let the user discover more information on a topic of their choice. The app will use three APIs to fetch interesting data/text/images/media related to that topic. The app should be able to create three requests simultaneously (e.g. by using Python's concurrency.futures), and then present data to the user when the results are returned.
