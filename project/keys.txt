Copy the text below into a python file called "keys.py"
that file will be ommitted from github automatically so keys are only local to a machine

class KeyDefinitions():
    @staticmethod
    def keys():
        details = {}
        # instead of manually editing a dictionary, use this syntax to add keys
        details.setdefault("some_key", "some_value")
        return details
